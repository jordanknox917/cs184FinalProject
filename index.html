                  <p>Our goal for this project is to create a program that is capable of taking in a .ply file of
                    vertices that will then
                    convert it into a mesh and then rendering the mesh. The .ply file is a point cloud, which is usually
                    the output produced
                    by 3D scanners. Our first step is reading the .ply file and computing the normals for each vertex in
                    the cloud. The next
                    step is to run the ball pivot algorithm on the points and normals together in order to generate the
                    faces. Finally, we
                    put together the vertices edges and faces in order to render the mesh. We used the browser
                    application threeJS in order
                    to render our finished mesh.</p>

                <h3 class="h5 date-title">Starting With Project 2</h3>
                <p>We had originally intended to use our project 2 code as the starter code for this project. It made sense, as this project's
                   last step is to render a mesh, and that's what the project 2 end product was. But, we hit a few snags in that plan. The first
                   snag was the format of the point cloud data we could find. All of the point clouds we could find were in .ply file format.
                   But the meshedit starter code took in meshes in .dae file format. We tried a few solutions to the conversion of .ply to .dae
                   but none of them worked very well and we did not want to spend hours learning to write our own .dae files, so we decided to
                   move away from the project 2 code as the base for our renderer. We looked at a few other ways to render the meshes we were
                   going to generate. Our first thought was to use a program called Blender, but upon further investigation, we realized that
                   blender was a bit too advanced than we needed for our render, and the finished products looked somewhat odd. Next we turned
                   to a program called ThreeJS and that's what we eventually used to render our finished mesh.

                <h3 class="h5 date-title">.ply Files</h3>
                <p>The first issue we had to tackle was dealing with the format of the point clouds. Most point clouds are found in
                  .ply
                  files. The .ply files are fairly easy to read and understand. We decided to use a repository from Stanford as our
                  source for the majority of our point clouds. The .ply files on that repository were comprised of vertices and faces.
                  We needed the vertices and the vertex normals in order to run our ball pivot algorithm. Then we erased the original
                  faces
                  from the .ply file. This gave us a .ply file that we could use the ball pivot algorithm on to generate a triangle
                  mesh.

                <h3 class="h5 date-title">The Ball Pivot Algorithm</h3>
                <p>The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm is named for the simulated use of a virtual ball to help reconstruct a mesh from a
                point cloud. To construct the mesh from the point cloud, you first assume that the cloud consists of points from the surface
                of the object we are trying to make a mesh for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The algorithm then works by simulatimng a tiny ball rolling across the points in the cloud. The ball's size is dependant
                   on the scale of the mesh. It is typically slightly larger than the average space between points. From there, you drop the
                   ball onto the points. It will end up settling on three points and that will be the "seed triangle". This is where we will
                   start our algorithm. From the seed triangle, we then roll the ball outwards in any direction over one of the edges formed
                   between two of the three points. The ball will then come to rest between the two starting points and one new one. This new
                   triangle will then be added to the mesh. This process will be repeated until all of the points have been touched and the
                   mesh is fully formed.
